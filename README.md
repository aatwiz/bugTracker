# BugTrackerApp

A simple Java bug tracker using Gson for JSON handling.

## How to Run Locally

1. Make sure you have **Java 21** installed.
2. Import the project into your IDE (e.g. Eclipse).
3. Add the `gson-2.10.1.jar` to your build path (or include it as a dependency).
4. Run the `bugtracker.Main` class.

## Notes

- This is a desktop Java application (not a web app), so it runs in the console.
- No server or localhost is required.
- JSON data is stored in a local file (if implemented).
